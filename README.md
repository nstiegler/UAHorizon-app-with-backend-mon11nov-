# Field Service Management Solution

## Overview

Welcome to yet another field service management solution! Because apparently, the world needed one more way to track people fixing things. This particular gem emerged from the UAH/SAIC Hackathon "Joint Concept Challenge" (October-November 2024), where we decided to solve the age-old question: "Where on earth are all our technicians?"

## The Problem

Picture this: You're trying to manage a fleet of technicians who are supposedly fixing things somewhere in the field. Are they actually working? Who knows! Thanks to our solution, you can now watch little dots move around on a map and pretend they're being productive. Revolutionary, right?

## Features That Will Probably Change Your Life\*

(\*Results may vary. Happiness not guaranteed.)

### Smart Job Scheduling

- Because apparently, Excel sheets weren't cutting it anymore
- Auto-assigns jobs based on skills (and maybe mood, we're not quite sure)
- Handles emergency requests (aka "everything is on fire")

### Real-time Tracking

- Watch your technicians' dots move around the map like a very slow game of Pac-Man
- Get updates that are almost real-time (give or take a few cosmic delays)
- Know exactly where your team is (unless they leave their phone in their car)

### Analytics Dashboard

- Graphs that go up and to the right (we hope)
- KPIs that will impress your boss
- Charts that make it look like you know what you're doing

### Integration Ready

- Plays nice with your existing systems (most of the time)
- Ready to connect to any CRM (that we've heard of)
- API so smooth it could moonlight as butter

## Technical Stuff (The Part Your Dev Team Actually Cares About)

### AWS Services (Because Who Doesn't Love a Good Cloud Solution?)

- Frontend: AWS Amplify Studio (Because regular React was too mainstream)
- API: AppSync with GraphQL (REST is so 2010)
- Database: DynamoDB (Because SQL is for people who like structure)
- Location: Amazon Location Service (Google Maps was asking for too much money)
- Auth: Cognito (Password requirements stricter than your high school principal)
- Compute: Lambda (Servers are so last decade)
- Analytics: QuickSight (Because Excel charts weren't fancy enough)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (you know the drill)
2. Set up AWS (hope you've got good credit)
3. Configure everything (may require sacrificing a rubber duck)
4. Cross your fingers
5. Run the following totally-not-copied-from-StackOverflow commands:

```bash
# Install half the internet
npm install

# Pray to the AWS gods
amplify init

# Watch your CPU fans spin
npm start
```

## Security Features

- Role-based access control (because we don't trust anyone)
- Authentication that's probably secure
- Encryption that would make your crypto friends proud
- Privacy compliance (GDPR? Never heard of her)

## Performance

- Blazing fast* (*when tested on our developer's M1 Max)
- Works offline (sometimes)
- Scales horizontally (and vertically if you push it hard enough)
- Optimized for maximum AWS bill optimization

## Contributing

Want to contribute? Really? Okay, here's how:

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a branch
3. Make your changes
4. Write tests (just kidding, who writes tests?)
5. Submit a PR and watch it sit there for months

## Support

If something breaks (and it will), you can:

1. Check the documentation (that we definitely kept up to date)
2. Google the error message
3. Try turning it off and on again
4. Finally give up and create an issue

## Acknowledgments

- Coffee (our true MVP)
- Stack Overflow (our real technical lead)
- The AWS documentation (our favorite fiction novel)
- That one intern who actually understood GraphQL

## License

MIT License (because we're too lazy to write our own)
